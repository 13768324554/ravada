## Introduction
It is probable that when you start reading this document, you have set up and install Ravada successfully and now it is time
to create a virtual machine. 

## Steps

1. First of all, log into Ravada using the username and password you created in previous steps of installation.
2. on top right of the page, click on "Admin Tools" and then "Machines".
3. In the new page, click on "New Machine".
4. Choose a name for your virtual machine and choose an option for the ISO image. the selected image needs to be installed 
accordingly. please note that you can see any upcoming error or problems in section "messages".
TEST: adding image to a .md file. ( I need to use git-hub help to figure this out, up to now I know that we need to upload the picture in repository and then add it to the page like what we do in SiWiki)
