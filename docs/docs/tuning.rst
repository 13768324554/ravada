Tuning Ravada
=============

Some additional settings to improve your Ravada installation.

IP Conflict
-----------

When there are machines that have been hibernated long ago, their ip
address may conflict with other that have just been created. That is
because the IP addresses have a short life span by default.

.. warning ::
    **TODO**
    Make IP addresses last forever changing the settings of dnsmasq.
