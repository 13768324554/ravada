New ISO image
==========================

In order to use an ISO file when you create a new machine, you must
first place it inside the KVM directory:

::
 
    /var/lib/libvirt/images
    
After you placed the ISO, you need to add the ISO into the SQL table:

::

    $ mysql -u rvd_user -p ravada
    mysql> INSERT INTO iso_images (name, description, arch, xml, xml_volume, md5, device)
            VALUES ('name','the description', 'i386', 'name.xml' ,'name-vol.xml','bbblamd5sumjustgenerated','/var/lib/libvirt/images/file.iso');

After that, Ravada is able to use the ISO when selecting it while creating a machine.
Also, ISOs that were downloaded from Ravada can also be found in this directory.

Ravada may also detect ISOs from ISO directories from your directory /home.
