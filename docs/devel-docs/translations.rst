Translations 
============

We use `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/ravada/ravada/>`__ to
provide a cleaner and easy to use interface for translators.

New entries must be added in the ``en.po`` file.
Because it is the basis of the other language files.
The language files are stored `here <https://github.com/UPC/ravada/tree/master/lib/Ravada/I18N/>`_ in lib/Ravada/I18N.

If you need to work directly in .po file, it's a good option use an application
like `Poedit <https://poedit.net/>`__.
