# How to add a new ISO image

ISO images are required to create KVM virtual machines. They can be placed or downloaded at run time.

## Placing your own ISO image

Copy the .iso file to the KVM storage, it is /var/lib/libvirt/images by default. Make sure everybody can read it

    # chmod 755 file.iso

Get the md5 for the ISO file, you will need it for the next step:

    # md5sum file.iso

Add an entry to the SQL table:

    $ mysql -u rvd_user -p ravada
    mysql> INSERT INTO iso_images (name, description, arch, xml, xml_volume, md5, device)
            VALUES ('name','the description', 'i386', 'name.xml' ,'name-vol.xml','bbblamd5sumjustgenerated','/var/lib/libvirt/images/file.iso');

## XML file

A XML template file is required if you want to create machines from this ISO. In the directory /var/lib/ravada/xml there are examples. You can make new ones creating a new machine from another tool like virt-manager. Once it is down dump the xml with

    # virsh dumpxml machine > name.xml

## XML Volume file

Create a new xml volume file based in another one from /var/lib/ravada/xml.

## Windows specifics

For Windows you will need the virtio ISO that can be downloaded from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso

Save it to /var/lib/libvirt/images and change the owner as you did for the Windows ISO.

    # chown 0750 /var/lib/libvirt/images/virtio-win-0.1.126.iso

Then edit your Windows xml file and point the second CD drive to that ISO. For the current stable virtio version, it looks like this:

    <disk type='file' device='cdrom'>
        <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
        <source file='/var/lib/libvirt/images/virtio-win-0.1.126.iso'/>
        <target dev='hdc' bus='ide'/>
        <readonly/>
        <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='1' target='0' unit='0'/>
    </disk>

You should also ensure that the system disk cache is set to 'directsync':

    <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' cache='directsync' io='native' />

If you're using the NEC xhci USB controller (the default one in our environment), you'll need to obtain a suitable driver for the ÂµPD720200 chipset. Plugable.com has it here http://plugable.com/drivers/renesas (2nd entry).
