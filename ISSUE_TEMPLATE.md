## TIPS FOR REPORTING ISSUES

Remember that courtesy and proper grammar go a long way. 
Please take the time to craft a precise, polite issue. 
We will do our best to help, but remember that this is an open source project - none of us are getting paid a salary to develop this project, or act as your personal support hotline ;-)

Carefully search the [existing issues](https://github.com/UPC/ravada/issues), both opened and closed. Your question may have already been asked and answered before!
