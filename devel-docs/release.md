Steps to release
===============

# Draft

## Draft the release

At code -> releases draft a new release


 * tag version : v0.2.2
 * release title : v0.2.2


## Create the milestone

At the _issues_ section , create a milestone. Name it like the tag version: 0.2.2. There must be a way to link it to the _tag_ , I just don't know how.

## Create issues

Assign issues to the milestone

# Close

## Close the milestone

Check the milestone has no open issues and close it.

## Update the authors

    $ git checkout master
    $ cd templates/bootstrap/
    $ ./get_authors.sh

It will create a file _authors.html.ep_, review it and commit it.

    $ git commit authors.html.ep
    $ cd ../..

## Update the release number

In _debian/control_ around line 2:

    Version: 0.2.5

Modify _lib/Ravada.pm_ around line 5:

    our $VERSION = '0.2.5';
